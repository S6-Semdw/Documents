There are a couple of reasons that will really benefit me to choose for this minor. I will be listing them down here so it has a nice structure to read.

1. Exposure to different cultures: Studying abroad allows me to immerse myself in a different culture and gain some new perspectives of the world depending on where i will be ofcourse. It gives me a good opportunity to learn about traditions and ways of life that are very different than my own.

2. Language: Studying abroad will improve my language skills a lot. By living and studying in a foreign country i will be surrounded by people that speak the certain language everyday. This gives me a great opportunity practice these skills in a real-world situation.
