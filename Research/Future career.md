# Future carreer

In this research i will be looking into possible minors and graduation internships. This will help me decide which route i will be going during the last year of and after my graduation.

## Minors

For the minors i'm interested in a minor abroad or the minor for entrepreneurship. 

#### Minor abroad

There are a couple of reasons that will really benefit me to choose for this minor. I will be listing them down here so it has a nice structure to read.

1. Exposure to different cultures: Studying abroad allows me to immerse myself in a different culture and gain some new perspectives of the world depending on where i will be ofcourse. It gives me a good opportunity to learn about traditions and ways of life that are very different than my own.

2. Language: Studying abroad will improve my language skills a lot. By living and studying in a foreign country i will be surrounded by people that speak the certain language everyday. This gives me a great opportunity practice these skills in a real-world situation.

3. Network: In a foreign country i will be meeting new people and this really helps with building my proffesional network. These connections are valuable later on in my career when i'm looking for a job or business partnerships when i have my own company for example.

4. Personal growth: being abroad is a lifechanging experience that helps me personally and professionaly. It challenges me to get out of my comfort zone and learn from new situations and develop new skills to help me in the future.

A good reason for me to choose for this minor is because im starting a software company with 2 friends of mine called d3vs. But there are also some other good reasons to choose this minor. They will also be listed down here.

1. Develop entrepreneurial skills: A minor in entrepreneurship provides an opportunity to develop skills such as creativity, innovation, problem-solving, critical thinking, and risk-taking. These skills are essential for starting and managing a successful business.

2. Learning from successful entrepreneurs: Many entrepreneurship programs offer opportunities to learn from successful entrepreneurs and business leaders. These individuals can provide valuable insights and mentorship that can help me succeed in ny own business. This can also help me starting up the business with my friends.

3. Networking: Pursuing a minor in entrepreneurship provides an opportunity to network with like-minded individuals who share your passion for business and entrepreneurship. These connections can be valuable in the future when you're looking for job opportunities, partnerships, or investors for your business.

4. Career opportunities: Even if we don't succeed in the business that i'm starting my with friends or it doesn't work out, a minor in entrepreneurship can provide valuable skills and knowledge that can be applied to a wide range of careers in fields such as marketing, sales, and management.

Overall, pursuing a minor in entrepreneurship can be a smart choice for anyone who is interested in business, innovation, and creating value. Whether you plan to start your own business or work in a more traditional role, the skills and mindset you develop in an entrepreneurship program can be valuable assets throughout your career.

## Internship/graduation 

For the graduation internship i looked at the options that fontys has given on their own platform. This is a good place to look for internships because company's can upload their applications and projects on there. The students can contact the company's way easier this way and have a good place to look for their internships. For this research i found 2 company's that i am interested in. I like fullstack development in general so i want to have an internship that provides that. 


#### Moonly

Moonly is a software company that makes tailor made software. This means that whatever the customer asks there is a good possibility they can make it for them. On the assignment details i saw they have an open spot for a fullstack developer as a graduation student. This would be exactly what i want so it's a good option as graduation company. They also have a lunch provided every day and chances to work remotly. Every friday they also order fries for the whole team before the weekend starts. Personally i like a team that is really connected to each other and have a good team spirit and with things like lunching together and having for example fries on friday this really builds a good team besides working together.


#### Webs

- [Webs online link](https://asam.fhict.nl/student/Assignment/Details/610c7437-3482-41d5-a87d-dad5c48cfe2c)

We are Webs, the #1 HubSpot Consultancy Partner for companies that want to grow smarter. Webs consists of a team of about 60 young professionals who are completely in love with HubSpot and everything that comes with it. As an Elite HubSpot Partner, we are among the absolute top worldwide. And as a fast-growing and dynamic environment, Webs is the ideal place to further develop your talents. This is where we focus on during this graduation internship. The team you will be working with consists of highly experienced Software Engineers, System Architects, Cloud professionals, and CRM consultants. Together, you will create the best possible solution for our clients. We mainly work for commercial departments of SaaS companies and B2B companies in the manufacturing industry. Translating business needs into a technical solution that actually helps them do what they're good at is what we wake up for every morning.

I personally believe that this internship would be a great fit for me. The fact that they provide a lot of freedom in choosing your end project is highly valuable to me, if it is possible, of course. Additionally, the team comprises many experienced professionals who I can learn from during the internship. This presents a valuable opportunity for me to expand my network and make new connections. Moreover, similar to the internship at Moonly, there is also a chance to work as a full-stack developer, which is also a great prospect. Another aspect I appreciate about the company is their reliance on teamwork, which is something I value as well. Just as much as the friday afternoon drinks.
