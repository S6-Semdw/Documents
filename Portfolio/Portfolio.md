# Portfolio S6 Sem de Wilde

## Introduction

This document is created to help the reader easily find the products i made for this semester. The reading guide is written for my personal portfolio and to show all the proof for my learning outcomes. There are 9 learning outcomes in total and during this semester i will get proof to get at least a proficient for every learning outcome. I will collect this evidence in a group and personal project.

### Group project: Stockbrood

The group project will be made in a group of 5 students. The product owner is a trader and wants a way to automate his trading strategies. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/S-A-RB05).

### Individual project: Twitter clone

The individual project is a twitter clone. This means i will be working with users and tweets that can be made. I will be using microservices en messaging in this project. The tech stack will be react and springboot. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/S6-Semdw).

## Learning Outcome 5 - Scalable Architectures
Besides functionality, you develop the architecture of enterprise software based on quality attributes. You especially consider attributes most relevant to enterprise contexts with high volume data and events. You design your architecture with future adaptation in mind. Your development environment supports this by being able to independently deploy and monitor the running parts of your application.

#### Kubernetes

On the first 2 images below you can see that I managed to make a Kubernetes cluster with in this case a pod for the twitteruserservice I made. The docker image I made earlier is actually in the pod so with this Kubernetes can later scale it when needed. On the second 2 images below that there is more proof that shows the information about the pod that is made in the cluster. This is straight from the terminal.

#### Scaling

As you can see on the image the pod scales when the load goes up. The load is generated with k6

### Score

#### Authentication

In the user service I made sure that a new user can register himself with this service. When te user is created he is also able to autheticate. Both of the request give the JWT token back so that I can verify that it's working. The proof is on the images below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4Nvm562M/Scherm-afbeelding-2023-04-04-om-15-12-18.png" width=500 height=250></td>

#### OWASP document

This document talks about 5 vulnerabilities that are most dangerous for my twitter application.

[OWASP twitter vulnerabilities document](https://github.com/S6-Semdw/Documents/blob/main/Individual%20project/General/OWASP10.md)

#### Snyk

I used Snyk for security and got some vulnerabilities to fix. On the images you can see that their is a PR made that fixes some dependencies because they had a high dangerous level on Snyk. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Y2NpcP2M/Scherm-afbeelding-2023-05-31-om-21-35-45.png" width=500 height=250></td>

  </tr>
</table>

#### Password hashing

When the user is created he will be saved in the MYSQL database as you can see on the image below. The password is hashed so that only the user knows it so this is very secure.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/66P3t9y9/Scherm-afbeelding-2023-04-04-om-15-16-27.png" width=500 height=250></td>
  </tr>
</table>


#### Roles

For the security by design I looked trough the canvas module. A good way to achieve this learning outcome would be to add roles so that is what i did. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/y69ZrDtb/Scherm-afbeelding-2023-05-08-om-00-22-33.png" width=500 height=250></td>

  </tr>
</table>

#### Encrypted secrets

I also added encrypted secrets in my repository for my dockerfile. This means that no one can see my docker username and password but my dockerfile still operates with them. So this is a safe way to still use the credentials that i need to run the file. I also got this from the security and design module on canvas.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/50JV4k9v/Scherm-afbeelding-2023-05-08-om-00-32-20.png" width=500 height=250></td>

#### Distributed data issues (independent database)

In my project, I have encountered several distributed data issues that can impact data consistency, integrity, and security. After careful analysis, I have identified the following challenges and devised corresponding solutions:

1. Data Synchronization: I have multiple independent databases in my application, and ensuring data synchronization has been a challenge. To address this, I could implement a master-slave replication model. Updates are made to a master database, and those changes are propagated to one or more slave databases. This approach helps maintain data consistency across all databases, and I am monitoring the replication process closely to ensure optimal performance.
2. Data Fragmentation: I noticed that data fragmentation across multiple databases can cause difficulties in accessing and analyzing the data effectively. To overcome this challenge, I could adopt a data virtualization approach. By presenting a single view of the data, I can eliminated the complexity of dealing with fragmented data sources. Additionally, I can use data integration tools to bring together fragmented data into a unified view, reducing duplication and inconsistencies.
3. Security and Access Control: Managing security and access control across different databases with varying policies can be a concern. To ensure consistent data security, I can implement encryption techniques at multiple levels. Database-level encryption, file-level encryption, and column-level encryption are used to protect data at rest and in transit. Furthermore, I could implement robust access controls, such as role-based access control (RBAC), to restrict unauthorized access, modifications, or deletions.

By recognizing these distributed data challenges. I could address data consistency, integrity, and security issues in my project. These measures could significantly improve the overall performance and reliability of my distributed database architecture.
