# Portfolio S6 Sem de Wilde

## Introduction

This document is created to help the reader easily find the products i made for this semester. The reading guide is written for my personal portfolio and to show all the proof for my learning outcomes. There are 9 outcomes in total and during this semester i will get proof to get at least a proficient for every learning outcome. I will collect this evidence in a group and personal project.

### Group project: Stockbrood

The group project will be made in a group of 5 students. The product owner is a trader and wants a way to automate his trading strategies. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/S-A-RB05).

### Individual project: Twitter clone

The individual project is a twitter clone. This means i will be working with users and tweets that can be made. I will be using microservices en messaging in this project. The tech stack will be react and springboot. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/S6-Semdw).

## Learning Outcome 5 - Scalable Architectures
Besides functionality, you develop the architecture of enterprise software based on quality attributes. You especially consider attributes most relevant to enterprise contexts with high volume data and events. You design your architecture with future adaptation in mind. Your development environment supports this by being able to independently deploy and monitor the running parts of your application.

## Learning Outcome 6 - Development and Operations (DevOps)
You set up environments and tools which support your chosen software development process. You provide governance for all stakeholders’ goals. You aim for as much automation as possible, to enable short release times and high software quality.

#### Docker 

On the images below you can see that a docker image is made. This is done automatically with GitHub actions and a Dockerfile ofcourse. On the right image you can that the actual image is pushed on docker hub.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MH6Kggjq/Scherm-afbeelding-2023-03-29-om-22-37-58.png" width=500 height=250></td>

  </tr>
</table>


#### Kubernetes

On the images below you can see that I managed to make a Kubernetes cluster with in this case a pod for the twitteruserservice I made. The docker image I made earlier is actually in the pod so with this kubernetes can later scale it when needed.

<table>

#### Automated testing


## Learning Outcome 7 - Cloud Services
You can explain what a cloud platform provider is and can deploy (parts of) your application to a cloud platform. You integrate cloud services (for example: Serverless computing, cloud storage, container management) into your enterprise application, and can explain the added value of these cloud services for your application.

#### Azure deployment



## Learning Outcome 8 - Security by Design
You investigate how to minimize security risks for your application, and you incorporate best practices in your whole software development process. 

### Score

| 1.1 | Sprint 1 | Individual project | Orienting |

#### Authentication

In the user service I made sure that a new user can register himself with this service. When te user is created he is also able to autheticate. Both of the request give the JWT token back so that I can verify that it's working. The proof is on the images below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/4Nvm562M/Scherm-afbeelding-2023-04-04-om-15-12-18.png" width=500 height=250></td>

  </tr>
</table>

#### Password hashing

When the user is created he will be saved in the MYSQL database as you can see on the image below. The password is hashed so that only the user knows it so this is very secure. He also has a User role.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/66P3t9y9/Scherm-afbeelding-2023-04-04-om-15-16-27.png" width=500 height=250></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Learning Outcome 9 – Distributed Data
You are aware of specific data requirements for enterprise systems. You apply best practices for distributed data during your whole development process, both for non-functional and functional requirements. You especially take legal and ethical issues into consideration.
