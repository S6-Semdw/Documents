# Graduation preparation

## Internship Any2Info

Any2Info has created a no-code platform where you can design and build mobile applications. As the name suggests, you don't need any code to create apps. This means you can quickly turn your ideas into a visual design and immediately test it live. The platform is fully available online and has many possibilities for customers to create an app that can take their business to the next level.

### Assignment

Any2Info supports a number of controls and fields on the dashboard and forms, but in some cases, these standard controls or fields do not meet the requirements of the customers. For these special cases, they want to support plugins where users can upload their own controls and fields. To support plugins, support must be added in the platform (configuration environment), web app (web portal for users), and in the Xamarin app. 

The different phases of this assignment are: 
-	Research plugin support for the web app 
-	Proof of concept plugin support for the web app 
-	Research plugin support for the Xamarin app 
-	Proof of concept plugin support for the Xamarin app 

### Evaluation

During the internship, I learned a lot. One of the most important points is communication. Because I got stuck a few times with certain coding problems, I communicated a lot with the developers to solve these issues. This was an important learning point for me. One area where I can improve myself is my speed. I notice that I take a long time to understand things in the field of code, and sometimes it takes up a lot of time. It does play a role that I am a beginner developer and have a lot to learn. This can be solved by asking a lot of questions and simply gaining more experience.

Moonly is a software company that makes tailor made software. This means that whatever the customer asks there is a good possibility they can make it for them. On the assignment details I saw they have an open spot for a fullstack developer as a graduation student. This would be exactly what I want so it's a good option as graduation company. They also have a lunch provided every day and chances to work remotely. Every Friday they also order fries for the whole team before the weekend starts. Personally, I like a team that is really connected to each other and have a good team spirit and with things like lunching together and having for example fries on Friday this really builds a good team besides working together. To get an internship here I would contact Moonly and ask for the possibilities.
