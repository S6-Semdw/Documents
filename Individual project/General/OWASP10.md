# OWASP 10 document

For my Twitter application, several vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10 could pose significant risks. Here are a few OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities that could be particularly dangerous for my Twitter application. They also explain why and how make sure they don't happen.

## 1. Injection Attacks (e.g., SQL injection, OS command injection): 

Injection vulnerabilities can occur if my application doesn't properly validate or sanitize user input. Attackers could inject malicious code into queries or commands, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access to the my backend systems.

## 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): 

XSS vulnerabilities can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users. Since my twitter relies heavily on user-generated content, an XSS vulnerability could enable attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of other users, potentially stealing sensitive information or spreading malware.

## 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): 

CSRF vulnerabilities can allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users. Attackers could trick users into unknowingly performing actions such as posting tweets, following accounts, or sending direct messages without their consent

## 4. Security Misconfigurations: 

Improperly configured security settings can leave the application vulnerable to various attacks. In the case of my Twitter application, misconfigurations such as weak authentication mechanisms, insecure storage of sensitive data, or unnecessary exposure of APIs could lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, or other security breaches. 

## 5. Insecure Direct Object References: 

If my Twitter application doesn't properly validate user access to resources, attackers might be able to manipulate object references and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform actions on behalf of other users.
